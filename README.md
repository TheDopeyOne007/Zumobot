# Zumobot
The name “sumo” came from an old Japanese sport, which is two opponents fighting in a ring, each of them trying to push the other opponent out of it, And this is what should robots also do in the sumo robotics competitions, where two robots placed in the ring and each other trying to push out its opponent.
